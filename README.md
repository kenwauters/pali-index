Manually curated Index of English Translations of the Pali Canon.

the files.


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome for content and code.  

When updating the indexes with new entries, run index.ts to update
the output and include the output in the PR.  In this repo we commit output for the
benefit of non-programmers who wish to use the index.

### Sutta Files 

Each sutta gets a file in `suttas`.  File extensions are csv.
The file is named after the volume and the
sutta numbers, so Majjhima Nikaya 1 is `mn-1.csv`.

See Sutta file `mn-1.csv` for comments on how to structure the files.
