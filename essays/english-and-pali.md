# English And Pali

There are three types of knowledge that are useful to pursuing awakening.
These are learning, reasoning, and direct knowledge, and they are 
(explained well here)[https://bhikkhu.wordpress.com/2006/10/19/understanding-the-dhamma-through-direct-knowledge/].

This index exists to support the first two types of knowledge, those gained
by learning and reasoning.  As such, it deals only with the English translations
of the Discourses, and is completely free of what I call the "Pali parsing" that
is so prevalent in the American Theravada community.  

This "Pali parsing" I have found to be unnecessary and counter-productive, but
since it is so prevalant, it seems reasonable to defend and clarify the sole
use of English translations in the development of all three types of learning.

## The Goal

Any decision to stick to English translations or delve deeply into the original
Pali is useful only insofar as it assists us in attaining the goal of awakening.

So we must spend some time examining awakening, and for a native English speaker
we can certainly get started on that with the English translations.  After some
careful reading, we can draw the two clear conclusions that the substance of
awakening is direct knowledge, and that this direct knowledge is never 
described with words because it cannot be.

Therefore, to put it simply, the choice of language in pursuing learning and
reasoning is irrelevant to the ultimate goal because learning and reasoning
only guide us in the pursuite of direct knowledge.  Any reasonbly clear expression of the Dhamma
in any language that guides the practioner to direct knowledge is sufficient.
Finally, in terms of efficiency, the best language in which to convey learning
and reasoning is the language the hearer understands best.

Going back to the first conclusion, it is enough to know that The Buddha
describes the awakening of a monk in terms of direct knowledge: "He knows by 
direct knowledge within himself, this is suffering..."  Monks who achieved
awakening in The Buddha's time were said to have attained "final knowledge,"
and the lion's roar of the monk achieving awakening speaks only generally
of what the monk now understands within himself, "what was to be done is
done."  I fully understand that these three examples are not sufficient to
defend the conclusion I have made, and a more robust defense will be broken
out into a separate essay once I have completed enough of the index to support
it with adequate citations.

For thes second conclusion, that the awakened state cannot be captured in words,
I will offer the same abbreviated defense of a single example concerning
Nibanna - the extinguishing of desire. Nibanna is described entirely in terms of
what it is not - what is absent.  The realization of Nibanna is not detailed
in the discourses, as it cannot be described in words.  

I should note here that
this brief statement is not a conflation of realizing Nibanna with awakening, as
The Buddha makes clear an unawakened person can realize and recognize Nibanna while
still falling into the error of identifying it with self.  

These few brief examples are sufficient I hope to establish at least the plausibility of
the premise of this index and these essays, that the English translations are
sufficient for enough learning and reasoning that the practioner can pursue
the real goal: awakening through direct knowledge.


## Pali Parsing

Having argued first for the basic plausibility that English translations are
all you need, I will now argue that a specific prevalent practice in the
Theravada community, which I call here "Pali parsing", is not only unnecessary
but actually distracting and counter-productive to the goal.  

This practice I noticed as consistent and prevalant from my first experience
in a Theravada meditation center in late 2016.  It always goes down the same
way.  An individual is attempting to pursue either learning, reasoning, or 
both, and is asking a question about the Dhamma.  Sooner or later the
conversation narrows to the definition and translation of one or more Pali
terms.  And there the discussion ends, almost every time, by one of two routes.
Either the questioner, finding themselves far out of their depth, abandons
the question, or the teacher responds that full and accurate translations
of the Pali are beyond available time and moves on to another question.

What is much more rare, so rare that it stuck in my mind the first time it
happened, is that the teacher draws the student back to the interaction
of learning and reasoning with the direct knowledge they gain from 
meditation, and the primacy of direct knowledge in following the path. 
The first time I heard this was the simple statement by a
young monk, "Do not think of Dhamma while meditating, during meditation
knowledge arises."

I like Pali, and I have studied it.  I have sat in sessions by Bikkhu Bodhi
and listened to far more of his sessions online where he extensively explains
the Pali and the subtleties of its translation.  I enjoy an essay here or there by this 
or that teacher on alternative translations of terms and phrases.  I enjoy these very much and
am grateful to all of those who have not only translated the Pali to English
but are willing to carefully explain the judgment calls and difficult decisions
that went into those translations.  But while I enjoy these things out of 
curiousity and the basic fact that they are so much of the fabric of American
Theravada interactions between teachers and students, I simply have not found them useful in the
pursuit of my practice.  

Instead, I found myself wondering, if these vast thousands of pages of English
verbiage cannot be discussed and used to promote knowledge without resort 
back to the Pali, then why bother translating them?   If they have value,
we should be clear about what that value is.

## The Path in English

The path leading to freedom from suffering begins when the practitioner forms a 
viewpoint, leading to intention and then action and effort upon that intention.  Action
leads to mindfulness and concentration.  All experiences after forming an intention
lead back to the refinement of the viewpoint and the cycle begins anew, leading
ultimately to awakening.

Everybody begins with an imperfect viewpoint informed by an imperfect understanding
of the Dhamma.  This beginning viewpoint, imperfect as it is, is formed when somebody
explains enough of the Dhamma to the student to be an effective starting point.

This early explanation and the formation of early viewpoints always occurs in the
student's vernacular.  I submit this as self-evident.  It can be contested perhaps
by a careful review of historical examples, which of course pale against the 
everyday experience of countless students throughout the centuries.

In later cycles, as the student progresses down the path, it is direct knowledge that
begins to take over through mindfulness and concentration.  It is direct knowledge that
fleshes out the gaps in the student's understanding of the Dhamma, and this direct
knowledge is free of the constraints of any language.

Therefore, the vernacular is perfectly suitable to form viewpoints around the Dhamma,
which lead to the direct knowledge necessary to advance in later stages.  As direct
knowledge has no dependency upon any human language, at no time is one language 
preferred over another except insofar as that language can be efficiently used by
the student.

## The Practical Reason

In addition to the entire explanation given above, there is another parallel reason
why I chose to use only the English translations of the Pali canon for this essay.

This reason is purely practical.  I wanted to write a series of essays on practice.
I wanted to provide citations, but in particular citations to the three elements I have
found in the written Dhamma: broad topics, narrow details, and stock phrases.  

As far as I can tell, such an index does not exist.  So, being a software engineer 
with the skill to create such an index, I determined to do so.  But then I ran into
the practical problem described above, the mixed use of English and Pali within the
community.  Do I index one or the other, or both?  An index in English would be subject to criticism over the choice of
words for translation, and an index in Pali would be less useful to beginners.  Trying
to do both would require a synonym system from day 1, adding complexity before I had
proven out any code or indexed even one discourse.

In the end the choice came down to two elements of my experience as a software
engineer.  The first is that one should always favor in early iterations the needs of
beginners, as you cannot in the beginning have enough complexity to satisfy advanced users.
Within the discipline of software engineering there is much experience that this is a good
strategy for both long and short term, as more advanced features are always best laid upon
simple robust foundations.  So that was the first engineering argument for an index of English topics, details, and
stock phrases - at least to start.

The second element of my experience is closely related to the first.  When an engineer 
is faced with complexities required early on, the best question to ask is usually, "is
this really necessary?"  If a simpler solution is built, such as indexing only English,
it may be that your users will be perfectly happy and never want the Pali.  Put another
way, given that you can only do one thing at a time, start with the thing you need
most for yourself - in my case English - and find out later if you also need the other
stuff.  So that was the second engineering argument for English only.

These two arguments can be taken together to present a synthetic technical argument around
code and data.  In all cases, you need an input to the index that is parsed and
processed into multiple outputs.  Sound data engineering wants to guarantee normalized
inputs (normalized means each fact is represented only once).   Having each fact listed 
only once means you create only one entry for every fact, so the first iterations of the
index cannot have entries that say, "self - not, see: not-self".  That feature is built later as a list of links
from your unique entries to all of their alternatives. Because we strongly suspect we will
want to add that "see also" system later just because it is so useful, we can see that
beginning only in English and without that synonym system lets us get off the ground with
the main effort while later adding synonyms that create results like "arahant, see: awakened being". 
So by limiting the index to English and without synomyms, we simplify early engineering, support
the effort to actually create the index, and allow for use of Pali later if desired.

## The Exceptions

Finally of course are the exceptions.  We still use some Pali terms where no translation is
possible.  These are:

* place names and person names 
* some words that the translators have left in Pali
    * dhamma, because its meaning almost always is derived from context
    * nibanna, because it has entered the mainstream
    * arahant, because that is the word in the text so it can be indexed with no special effort
    * The Buddha, as this is a title for a specific person`

Other words left in Pali are translated and English is used.  For example, "Discourse" instead
of "Sutta".
