# Renunciation

The Buddha said of his path, "It is a life of renunciation." 

In some ways he had it easy.  Indian society at that time supported the
wandering ascetics who roamed from town to town offering anything from
good luck and blessings to services such as spell casting in exchange for
a meal.  

It also does not seem like The Buddha, when he was Sidhatta Gotoma, felt
like he was giving up much.  He says in one of his stock phrases, "The home
life seemed dusty and crowded."  He longed for the freedom of the road, and
after wondering, "suppose I shave off my hair and beard and don the yellow
robe," he decided to go ahead with it.  Claiming, "it must be hard to reach
the goal while living the home life."  

Renunciation for us in the USA in the 21st century is not so straightforward.
There is no path for us anything like the one Siddhatta took - no tradition
of the wandering holy man or woman who comes into town and is fed each day
by this family or that, in exchange for whatever schtick he has to offer.

Nor is there much of an option in becoming a monk.  For one, it is a kind of
big bang all-at-once sort of renunciation.  But worse, I have never met a monk
who lives anything like the life of the wandering ascetic.
The monks I know are busy folk, as are those I know only
by reputation, 
living a life every bit as busy and crowded as my own life as a lay person.

So it seems we must find our own path of renunciation.

## The Wandering Ascetic

For my first few years as a Buddhist I had no interest in renouncing anything.
Meditation and friends in the practice were both new and refreshing, and were
rewarding enough.  As I read the discourses and began to grasp the level of
renunciation practiced by The Buddha and his friends, something far more
austere than anything I had encountered, it sent a chill down my spine.  It 
did not bear thinking about.  It felt like total loss, with no gain past
what I already had.

But over time it became clear that attachments and their attendant suffering
do not vanish even with an hour a day on the cushion.  Somehow or another
I would need to begin the process of renunciation.  Sure enough, as soon as
I knew there was no avoiding it, I got right to work avoiding it, and managed to take no
action for a long time.

Then came Covid and its forced isolation, and I stumbled into a simple solution.
Being as I worked from home during lockdown, home could be anywhere.  Like Siddhatta,
I began to wonder, "suppose I give up my couch and television and go forth from
apartment life into hotels."  Across a period of 3 weeks and several changes of 
plans around where to live, I found I yearned for the open road.  So I put 
everything into storage and hit the road.

I still have the same job, still work from "home", except that I have no home.  I spend
Monday-Friday in one place, paying a weekly rate at a hotel, then move on to wherever
I feel like over the weekend.

The first night in Sault St Marie was terrifying.  My entire life I had had somewhere
to return to, some place I called "home", where my stuff was where I had left it.  Where
I had my own towels.  Where a spot in the basement or garage had my
work bench and some tools.  My bed.  My blankets.  My utensils, pots, pans.  My bathroom,
painted to my taste, with the shower head I had carefully picked out.  

Now it was all dumb luck.  This hotel was too close to the road - noisy.  That one had
an odd smell.  No thermostat on the heater, so you either left it on at night and had to
get up at night to turn it off, or left it off and wore multiple layers to bed.

The meditation here is simple.  

## Alms versus Job


And as a practical matter this is where planning became necessary.  I once landed in a 
place whose internet was junk.  Made it difficult to get my job done.  As much as my
job is my daily "alms round", and the body must be maintained, I learned to call ahead
and specifically
